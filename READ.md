Etch-a-Sketch Project

Assignment:
- Create a grid using JS and append to HTML container
- Change colour of the divs in grid as mouse hovers, include random RGB values also.
- Add prompt to ask user how many squares per grid
- run functions from click of button tags in HTML

I enjoyed the process of this project. I felt reasonably competent in using google to find code samples for some of the things new to me and adapted those to work within the JS script.
In addition to the above I added error handling on the input prompt.
I also set the mouse hover to only be active after a button press and square size selection.

I have a number of repeated functions for button press. I attempted to attach listener to group of nodes but it failed to identify correct button on click.  One to review and refactor code.

I wanted to let the user switch between default grey and colour without prompting for square size on each button press. I can only think I would need to redesign and have a separate button for selecting square size and some other method to not activate mouse hover until this and subsquent draw / colour button pressed.
